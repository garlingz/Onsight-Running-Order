# RO_app
Generates running order times for Onsight Climbing competitions. Using Python with libraries to create a standalone exe application.

**<u>Project Goals</u>**
* Learn Object Oriented Programming by using Classes and Functions for project - Didn't do very well.
* Learn how to make an interactable interface using Python. &#x2705;
* Be able to present project to BP. &#x2705;
* Program should be able to:
    * Have a changeable Start time. &#x2705;
    * Have changable round length (default 4 minutes) &#x2705;
    * Changable transition time (default 15 seconds) &#x2705;
    * Be able to insert break times inbetween categories &#x2705; (manually)
    * <s>Autopopulate categories based on age groups</s>
    * <s>Able to customize age groups, default to USAC </s>
    * Change how many boulders in a round &#x2705;
    * Display start times for each competitor &#x2705;
    * Display start time for each boulder per competitor
    * Toggle to show what time competitor needs to be sitting in chair (1 round before their climb) &#x2705;
    * Be able to randomize order of competitors

**<u>Barebones Goals</u>**
* Start Time, Non-GUI &#x2705;
* Participant List &#x2705;
    * Right now it can handle importing a csv file, or by manual entry. Want it to obviously be able to handle other input types.
* Start/End Time for each climber &#x2705;
* <s>Categories or Age Groups</s> 
    * Don't think it needs age groups or categories. Instead, the user can just enter in each group as they need.. 
* What time each climber needs to be sitting in the ready-up chair. &#x2705;
* Layout for data to be shown and export formats &#x2705;
    * Columns for each climber:
        * Name, Chair Time, Boulder 1 Start, <s>Boulder 2 Start, Boulder 3 Start, Boulder 4 Start </s>, End Climbing &#x2705;
