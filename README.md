# Running Order Application
RO_app is a python program which lets the user generate "run times" for onsight climbing competitions.

## Installation
Downloaded from the Releases section (Current Version 1.0.0) or by GoogleDrive on request.

## Usage
![new_window](new_window.PNG)

### Competition Start Time
This box accepts military time in the HH:MM Time format. This time determines when the first climber will being climbing.

### Time per Boulder
The alloted climbing time of the round. USA Climbing default is 4 minutes, written as 4:00. This accepts MM:SS Time format.

### Transition Time inbetween Boulders (seconds)
How many seconds will be given as a transition period, during this time nobody will be climbing. USA Climbing default is 15 seconds.

### Boulders in the Round
How many boulders will each competitor go through in their round. 

### List of Competitors
List out Competitor names seperated by a new line. Each competitor in the list will be assigned a chair time, a start time, and an end time.

### Randomize
Shuffles the order of competitiors provided in the Competitor List.

### Clear
The clear button will delete the entries in **Competition Start Time**, **Time per Boulder** and **List of Competitors**. It will retain the information in **Transition Time** and **Boulders in the Round**, which can be edited if needed.

### Submit
Using the information entered, the program will open a new window showing a **Chair Time**, **Start Time** and **End Time** as well as a few other buttons.

### Create Timer
Opens the **TimerApp** using **Time per Boulder** and **Transition Time**. This is a shortcut, but runs the same timer as the one found in the *Second Window*.

### Copy to Clipboard
Copies all text in the field to the clipboard.

### Save as CSV File
Create a Comma Seperated Values file containing the information in the text field. This format is accepted by Excel/Sheets.

### Create Timer
**TimerApp**
Opens a standalone timer based on user input from the first window.

### Start/Resume
Starts the timer or resumes the timer when paused.

### Stop
Pauses the timer at current time. The timer can be reset or resumed when in the paused state.

### Reset
Resets the timer to the original values for both the climbing time and transition time.

# Scoring Application
Scores is a scoring application to run alongside the RunningOrder application. Eventually its functionality will be added to the RunningOrder application. 
Scores ranks climbers by their scores (Tops, Zones, Lowzones, attempts to each).

## Installation
Downloaded from the Releases section (Current Version 1.0.0) or by GoogleDrive on request.

## Usage

### Entry Fields

#### Climber Name
Name of the climber that the following scores will be associated with.

#### Category

#### Tops 
Tops are entered first as the total number of boulders where the Top was achieved, followed by the TOTAL attempts it took to achieve those tops. (Tops, attempts)

#### Zones
Zones are entered first as the total number of boulders where the Zone was achieved, followed by the TOTAL attempts it took to achieve those zones. (Zones, attempts)

#### Low Zones
Completely optional field, if nothing is entered the score is assumed as 0,0. Format follows that of Zones and Tops.

### Buttons

#### Add Climber
Adds the climber and assoicated scores to the leaderboard. This will also update the standings in the leaderboard text field on the right.

#### Edit Climber

**NOTE:** The leaderboard text field can be selected to copy, but cannot directly be edited. Instead, use the entry field buttons to make any changes necessary.




# **<u>Project Goals</u>**
* Learn Object Oriented Programming by using Classes and Functions for project...
* Learn how to make an interactable interface using Python. &#x2705;
* Be able to present project to BP. &#x2705;
* Program should be able to:
    * Have a changeable Start time. &#x2705;
    * Have changable round length &#x2705;
    * Changable transition time (default 5 seconds) &#x2705;
    * Be able to insert break times inbetween categories &#x2705; (manually)
    * <s>Autopopulate categories based on age groups. </s> Removed because it wasn't necessary.
    * <s>Able to customize age groups, default to USAC. </s> See above.
    * Change how many boulders in a round &#x2705;
    * Display start times for each competitor &#x2705;
    * Display start time for each boulder per competitor. ðŸ™ˆ
    * Toggle to show what time competitor needs to be sitting in chair (1 round before their climb) &#x2705;
    * Be able to randomize order of competitors &#x2705;
    * Columns for each climber:
        * Name, Chair Time, Boulder 1 Start, <s>Boulder 2 Start, Boulder 3 Start, Boulder 4 Start </s>, End Climbing &#x2705;

# **<u>To-Do</u>**
* User interface overhall. Making things more user friendly and pleasant to look at.
* Add functionality to run the TimerApp without using it for a climbing round timer (removed transition sounds).
* Package program to include all dependencies (like the mp3 sound files)
* Pick from a dropdown list which types of notification sounds to use for TimerApp audio.
* <s>Host new application on Git LFS. </s> Moved to hosting on the Github Releases tab. &#x2705;
* Match color scheme to what USA climbing uses. &#x2705;
* Match sounds to what USA climbing uses. &#x2705;
