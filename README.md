![new_window](assets/new_window.PNG)
##### **Competition Start Time:**
* This box accepts military time in the HH:MM Time format. This time determines when the first climber will being climbing.
##### **Time Per Boulder:**
* The alloted climbing time of the round. USA Climbing default is 4 minutes, written as 4:00. This accepts MM:SS Time format.
##### **Transition Time:**
* How many seconds will be given as a transition period, during this time nobody will be climbing. USA Climbing default is 15 seconds.
##### **Boulders in the Round:**
* How many boulders will each competitor go through in their round. 
##### **List of Competitors:**
* List out Competitor names seperated by a new line. The order of competitors can be randomized using the "Randomize Competitor" button.
##### **Create Timer:**
* Opens the **TimerApp** using **Time per Boulder** and **Transition Time**. This is a shortcut to the timer without needing participants.

After submitting competitors, a new window is opened.
